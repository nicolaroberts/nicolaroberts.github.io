tags: [web, git, jekyll]

This blog site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted for free using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The design is thanks to [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes) and his [HPSTR](https://mademistakes.com/work/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) Jekyll theme. 

## Basic steps

* Fork the [HPSTR Jekyll theme repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme)
* Clone locally
* Create a new repo on GitHub called `username.github.io`
* Reset the primary remote repository (origin) of the local cloned copy so that it points to `https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git`
* Delete non-master branches
* Make edits to the source files as desired (see below)
* Push changes to remote origin on GitHub 
* GitHub automatically builds a website from the source in repo `username.github.io`, giving it the address `http://username.github.io/`


## Personalise content


Edit these files to personalise site content:

* `_config.yml`
* `_data/navigation.yml` defines links on side menu
* `_posts/` remove default template posts and start writing new content
* `about/index.md` About page
* `README.md` the README visible on the GitHub source page


## Build the site locally

Build the site locally and check any updates before pushing the changes to the public face on GitHub. 

First time:

* `sudo gem install bundler`
* `sudo gem install jekyll`
* In folder with the website repo: `bundle install`

Every time:

* `bundle exec jekyll build`
* `bundle exec jekyll serve` 
* Paste local server address into browser
* Simply refresh the browser to incorporate edits on the go


## Enable DISQUS comments system

* Get Disqus account, click 'Add Disqus To Site', fill out details
* Will create site `https://disqus_shortname.disqus.com/admin/moderate/`
* Edit `disqus_shortname` field in `_config.yml`

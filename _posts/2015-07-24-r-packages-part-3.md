In part 3: to do.  

See [part 1]({{ site.url }}/r-packages-part-1) for R package set up, directory structure, the DESCRIPTION file, writing R code for packages, using roxygen2 to write documentation and define the package namespace, and a simple build protocol. 

See [part 2]({{ site.url }}/r-packages-part-2) for topcis.
